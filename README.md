## Usage

### Example: Create a Simple Tone

1. Include the library in your project:

   ```html
   <script type="module">
       import { parseYAML, generateWAV } from './dist/index.js';

       // Define YAML data
       const yamlData = `
       tempo: 120
       tracks:
         - instrument: sine
           notes:
             - frequency: 440
               duration: 1
             - frequency: 660
               duration: 1
       `;

       // Parse the YAML
       const score = parseYAML(yamlData);

       // Generate WAV data
       const wavBuffer = generateWAV(score);

       // Create a downloadable WAV file
       const blob = new Blob([wavBuffer], { type: 'audio/wav' });
       const link = document.createElement('a');
       link.href = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
       link.download = 'output.wav';
       link.textContent = 'Download Generated Audio';
       document.body.appendChild(link);
   </script>
   ```

2. Open the HTML file in your browser, and the WAV file will be generated and available for download.
