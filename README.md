   ```html
    <!-- Include the pn-library.js script -->
    <script src="pn-library.js"></script>

    <script>
        // Wrap everything in an async function
        async function runPNExample() {
            console.log(PN);  // This should print the PN object

            PN.instrument('Banjo'); // Select the instrument
            // PN.setVolume(0.5); // Set volume (optional)

            // Wait for PN.singVoice to complete
            const song = await PN.singVoice('recording2.wav');

            console.log("Song created:", song);
            console.log(PN.volume);  // Logs the current volume
                setTimeout(() => {
                    PN.save(); // Call save after the delay

                }, 8000); // Delay in milliseconds (5000ms = 5s)
        }

        // Run the function
        runPNExample();

    </script>
   ```
