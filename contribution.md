Here's how you can contribute:

**1. Fork the Repository:**

Go to the PlayNoise.js repository on GitHub: [https://github.com/PlayNoise/PlayNoise.js](https://github.com/PlayNoise/PlayNoise.js) and click the "Fork" button in the top right corner. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PlayNoise.js.git
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

**3. Create a Branch:**

Create a new branch for your contribution. This keeps your changes isolated from the main codebase and makes it easier to manage pull requests.  Use a descriptive branch name related to the change you're making.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```
or
```bash
git checkout -b bugfix/fix-specific-bug
```

**Coding Standards and Requirements for Acceptable Contributions:**

* **Code Clarity and Readability:** Write clean, concise, and well-documented code. Use meaningful variable and function names. Add comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious code sections.

* **Testing:** Whenever possible, include tests for your changes.  If you're fixing a bug, add a test that demonstrates the bug is fixed. If you're adding a new feature, add tests to cover its functionality.

* **Documentation:**  If your contribution introduces new features or changes existing functionality, please update the documentation accordingly.
